{"question": "What is the difficulty level of the tour?","answer": "This depends on which tour you’ll be joining. Please refer to our Adventure Level pyramid for a breakdown of the differing levels of difficulty our tours provide. Detailed requirements for each Adventure Level can be found on each tour page.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-1"}
{"question": "What is the weather like in the cave and jungle?","answer": "In Winter (November to February), sometimes there are cold spells that last around 5-7 days or more, and the temperature could drop to 8-18°C (47-65°F). When the temperature goes below 18°C (65°F), we will use a boat or raft, rather than swimming. From March to May, most of the time the weather is cool. It can be hot or cold on some days. In Summer (June - August), the temperature is around 32-38°C (90-100°F), so you can enjoy swimming in the river, stream, and inside the caves. The temperature inside the cave usually keeps at 18-23°C (65-73°F) in Winter, and 22-25°C (71-77°F) in Summer.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-1"}
{"question": "How can I best prepare for a tour during summer?", "answer": "Summers here are hot… very hot. Average temperatures range from 32 – 40 degrees Celsius. There is a high level of humidity as well so please be prepared ahead of time. Check weather conditions carefully via a weather website such as: http://www.accuweather.com/en/vn/phong-nha/418626/weather-forecast/418626 about 7 days in advance to get the best idea of what the weather will be like during your tour. Plan to drink lots of water before, during, and after your tour. Consider bringing rehydration tablets with you to help keep your salts balanced as you sweat; your tour guide will also carry some for emergency situations. Also, reduce the amount of alcohol you drink (go easy on the rice wine we provide!) because alcohol can increase dehydration. Finally, don’t forget to pack a hat, sunscreen, sunglasses, and also long sleeves can be helpful to protect your skin from the sun. We recommend wearing long sleeves and require long pants even in the summer. While it may seem counter intuitive, it can actually help to keep you cooler and pants especially are a necessity to protect against elements like sharp rocks, prickly plants, insects, etc.", "url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-1"}
{"question": "Do I need to know how to swim for your tours?", "answer": "Oxalis offer different types of tours. Although you will still get wet from river crossings, it is not necessary to swim for Hang En, Hang Va, Hang Tien 1 day and 2 days, or Son Doong. You do need to have basic swimming skills for any Tu Lan tour. Life jackets will be provided by Oxalis and are compulsory for swimming inside the caves. Your tour guide and safety assistant can assist you in the swimming portions.", "url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-1"}
{"question": "Do I need to know how to rappel/abseil for your tours?", "answer": "You DO NOT need any prior experience in rappelling/abseiling. On the Tu Lan Expedition tour, we do have an underground abseil, but before you do the abseil you will have a short practice with the abseiling equipment and full instructions and support from our internationally qualified guide & safety team.", "url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-1"}
{"question": "Do I need to provide my own helmet, harness, rope, or caving equipment?", "answer": "No – we will provide for you all the necessary caving equipment, including helmet, harness, and rope where necessary. We will also provide for you a high-powered head torch for caving throughout each day, but please bring a small head torch that would be appropriate for around the campsite each night if you have one. Please check the itinerary and packing list for your tour clearly, to know what to bring. Regarding helmets, please do not place any GoPro mounts on our helmets as they increase wear and tear and void the manufacturer’s warranty.", "url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-1"}
{"question": "What is the cave floor like? Is it flat?", "answer": "The cave floor is anything but flat, it is very uneven. There will be slopes, climbs, rocks and giant boulders in places.. Please expect to be traveling on this kind of terrain.", "url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-1"}
{"question": "What are the sleeping/bedding conditions like? Do I need to bring a sleeping bag or tent?", "answer": "In all of our tours, you will be provided with a tent (single or double choices are upon request), sleeping bag with mattresses & pillow. The porters will carry these items to camp and set them up for you.", "url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-1"}
{"question": "Do I need to bring my own water pump or water purification tablets on tour?", "answer": "No. You do not need a water pump or purification tablets; your guide will have a high-quality water pump on him at all times for filtering water for you. Please do not fill your water bottle directly from the river! Instead, inform your guide when you need more water. Filtered and boiled water is provided in all campsites.", "url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-1"}
{"question": "What kind of food will there be on the tour? Do I need to bring my own snacks?", "answer": "There will be a wide variety of different types of food served on all of our tours, and plenty of it. We are able to accommodate those with most dietary restrictions or preferences, but please notify us ahead of time so that we are better able to make accommodations for you in advance. It is easy for us to prepare vegetarian food. However, if you are vegan or gluten-free, we are able to accommodate your eating restrictions at mealtimes (if you advise us in advance), but it is more difficult during snack breaks. Please bring some of your own snacks (trail mix, nuts, protein bars, etc.) to make sure that you have snack options on hand for extra energy when needed.", "url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-1"}
{"question": "What if I am a solo traveler, can I join a group?", "answer": "Solo travelers are most welcome and make up a large percentage of most groups.", "url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-1"}
{"question": "Will we encounter any dangerous animals in the jungle?", "answer": "You are unlikely to come across anything too dangerous. The guide will always go first and a guide assistant or porter will always go last, so they would be first to spot any possible dangers. You may come across a snake, but it’s a very rare chance of you being the first to see it. If you do come across one, do not play with it or attack it. There are poisonous snakes in Vietnam so do not take any chances. Spiders are not known to be dangerous in these parts of Vietnam. Caterpillars and centipedes can be irritating and sometimes dangerous so please do not touch these intentionally, or any other animal or insect. You are likely to encounter leeches. They are not dangerous, just irritating. We tuck our long pants into our socks and this stops the majority of leeches. If you are unlucky enough to have been bitten by one, you will bleed for a while and that’s all. They do not seem to carry any infections but we always use a precautionary antiseptic after it has stopped bleeding.", "url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-1"}
{"question": "Do we have to swim, even in winter?", "answer": "The following tours require swimming: Tu Lan 1-Day Experience; Tu Lan Cave Encounter (2D1N); Wild Tu Lan Cave Explorer (3D2N); Tu Lan Expedition (4D3N), Hang Tien Exploration ( 3D2N). If you’re not comfortable with swimming, we provide rafts as an alternative. Please note that all Tu Lan tours will follow an amended itinerary when the weather is extremely cold, and swimming will be limited or omitted at the tour guide’s discretion if the temperature drops below 18 degrees Celsius.",

{"question": "How many miles or kilometers will we be walking on each tour?", "answer": "It’s entirely dependent on which tour you take. Please refer to the Quick Facts or Adventure Level under each tour description to see the distance you will cover.", "url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-1"}
{"question": "How long is the swimming part? Can I get any support if I cannot swim?","answer": "Swimming requirements and lengths depend on which tour you join. Please refer to detailed itineraries on each tour’s webpage for exact lengths of the swimming portions. If you cannot swim at all, we recommend booking a tour with no swimming involved such as Hang En, Hang Tien Endeavor (2D1N), Hang Tien Experience (1D), Phong Nha National Park 1 day or Hang Va. If you have just basic swimming skills, your tour guide and porter team can assist you in the swim sections. All customers are required to wear a life-jacket while on tour, regardless of swimming abilities. As mentioned in the previous answer, we do provide rafts for guests that don’t wish to swim.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-1"}
{"question": "I am claustrophobic, does this present a problem? Are there any tight squeezes in the cave?","answer": "There is nowhere where you actually need to squeeze. There are some points where the cave can be quite narrow, or the roof a bit low, but you will easily be able to pass.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-1"}
{"question": "Where do we camp if it rains?","answer": "Regardless of rain, campsites will remain the same and there will be a tarp covering the sleeping site.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-1"}

You’ll be invited to sample traditional Vietnamese rice wine and you can choose to take part in games around the campfire, like card games, etc. Please also feel free to bring any small games along with you.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-1"}
{"question": "How many people are usually on each join-in tour?","answer": "The number of participants per Adventure tour is subject to change at management’s discretion.

{"question": "What sort of clothing should I bring on the tour?","answer": "While it varies how many sets you will want to bring depending on how long your tour is, we do recommend long sleeves and require long pants for the best protection in the jungle and caves. We absolutely recommend bringing extra warm clothes in winter (mid-November to mid-March). If you don’t have either, they are usually available for purchase at our Oxalis office. Please refer to the packing list (“What We Will Provide/What You Need to Bring”) specific to the tour you have signed up for.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-1"}
{"question": "What sort of boots/shoes should I bring on the tour?","answer": "This is an extremely important consideration. The going underfoot is tough. Your footwear will get totally submerged many times a day on every tour (especially Tu Lan tours). There is a lot of scrambling over boulders so good grip and comfortable footwear is essential. It’s best to find a pair of trail running, shoes/boots with the softest and stickiest rubber possible, as this ensures the best grip. If you’d like to borrow a pair of our jungle boots, you are welcome to, but please note that they are minimalistic jungle army boots. (Gore-Tex or waterproof boots are NOT recommended but, if you have a comfortable boot with a good grip and it happens to be Gore-Tex or waterproof, they are still acceptable.)","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-1"}
{"question": "Will I be able to change my footwear for river crossings to keep my feet dry?","answer": "You cannot change your footwear for river crossings because wading takes place a lot during the trip. Please expect your feet to be wet for most of each day of your tour.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-1"}
{"question": "Do I need a backpack?","answer": "You will need a medium-sized backpack (25 liters) that contain your personal items: water, camera, sunscreen, bug spray, head torch that provided, etc. It’s also great if it can fit your helmet in (since you won’t need to wear it until reaching the cave). The porters will carry your change of clothes to camp for you. The rest of your luggage can be stored at our office and we also have a locker to store valuable items.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-1"}
{"question": "Do I need a drybag?","answer": "We will provide you with a semi-dry bag for all tours. This bag will contain all items you’d like with you during the day. A drybag is still a good consideration because you will never know when there could be surprise showers during your tour, regardless of the month of the year. It’s a good idea to have a dry bag for your backpack at least, due to the humid conditions in the jungle and cave, especially in the rainier months of February – early April. Please do not place valuable items such as electronics or vital personal medication in the semi-dry bag, as Oxalis will not take responsibility for any leaks which may occur. A drybox will be provided for any electronic items at any swimming sections.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-1"}
{"question": "Should I bring a swimsuit?","answer": "Please bring swimwear for Hang En, Hang Tien, and Tu Lan tours. We request that you do not wear your swimwear (especially bikinis) as you walk or lounge around camp, for the respect of our porter team.

{"question": "Should we bring our own water bottle?","answer": "We will offer you the use of a 1L bottle at departure point. The water bottles will be refilled on tour with the use of our water filters.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-1"}
{"question": "What can I buy in Phong Nha?","answer": "Long-sleeved trekking shirts, short sleeve cotton shirts, trekking pants, Oxalis trekking sandal( Dép rọ) and bandanas can all be purchased at the Oxalis office (subject to availability). We don’t recommend relying solely on our merchandise in case we are out of your size or low on inventory.

Do not rely on buying anything here.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-1"}
{"question": "Why must I wear long pants and long sleeves on tour?","answer": "We require that you wear long pants and we recommend long sleeves in order to protect yourselves in many ways. You may encounter sharp rocks, thorny bushes, stinging plants, mosquitoes and more in the jungle; therefore, long pants and long sleeves provide added protection against these elements. Long pants must be worn inside the caves.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-1"}
{"question": "How will we go to the toilet in the cave?","answer": "You are not allowed to go to the toilet inside any of the caves. We will provide a “composting” toilet at each campsite for you to go to the bathroom in (somewhat) comfort. The toilets are designed with a seat atop a steel box over a bucket, in an enclosed shelter for privacy. The composting toilets work with the aid of dried rice husks. After doing your business, you will scoop rice husks into the bucket, and the rice husks serve to compost everything and eliminate any smells. Please be generous with the rice husks and scoop enough to cover all waste (don’t put anything but toilet paper in the compost toilets!). At meals and at the toilets in the camps, an alcohol hand gel will be available and you must use it to avoid getting sick! We also advise bringing your own antiseptic hand gel (preferably ethyl alcohol level of 70% or above, since this is not available to us here). Soap and water are also available outside all compost toilets.\nNote: If you go to a bathroom and find that either the rice husks, toilet paper, hand gel, or soap and water are low or out, please notify your tour guide immediately.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-3"}
{"question": "How will I go to the bathroom if I’m not at a campsite?","answer": "If you cannot hold it until you reach a compost toilet, you may go to the toilet in an area of the jungle where no one can see you and far away from the river. Please do not leave behind any toilet paper that you use (we can provide you with sanitary bags at the start of your trek). Please place any other feminine hygiene products in these sanitary bags as well. The sanitary bags must be disposed of at the rubbish bins at the campsite.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-3"}
{"question": "What kind of toiletries should I bring?","answer": "Only the necessities please. These include toothbrush, toothpaste, sunscreen, insect spray, and necessary medications. Ladies, please bring any feminine hygiene products that you may need on the tour with you from home. There are VERY limited options in the local market here and no options while on tour. Please pack accordingly for emergencies!","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-3"}

{"question": "Is there somewhere to change money in Phong Nha?

Their hours are 8 – 11 am and 2 – 4:30 PM Monday-Friday (closed on weekend and all public holidays). They can only exchange USD, and the USD bills must be in perfect condition.

Therefore, a tip would be very welcome. Some customers do not tip, some customers tip 10%, and some customers tip much more. We will collect any tips you’d like to leave on the return back to the office. The amount you tip should of course be based on the service and experience you receive. Tipping is not mandatory but highly appreciated.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q1-7"}
{"question": "What is the difficulty level of the expedition?","answer": "The Son Doong Cave Expedition is considered difficult (highest level) and you must be physically active with regular trekking experience. Please check the Adventure Level section on the Son Doong Expedition page for more detailed information of what you have faced during the trip.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q2-1"}
{"question": "There’s a famous photo online where a man is rappelling/abseiling into the cave, isn’t that how we enter?","answer": "That picture (while breathtakingly beautiful) was arranged only for National Geographic, and it took several days to set up the shot. You will not abseil into the cave. Also, that photo was taken at one of the dolines, not the entrance to Son Doong. The entrance to Son Doong is a darker and more mysterious-looking place, but equally beautiful.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q2-1"}
{"question": "How high is the Great Wall of Vietnam?","answer": "You will need to climb 90m in total to conquer the Great Wall of Vietnam.",
"url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q2-1"}
{"question": "How do I climb up the Great Wall of Vietnam?","answer": "There are three stages of climbing up the Great Wall of Vietnam. You will climb the first vertical section using a fixed steel ladder then keep climbing using ropes in the next two sloping sections. You will be equipped with full safety equipment  at all times during the climb and will be clipped to a safety line controlled by our safety team. Members of the safety team will be at various points on the climb to help and encourage you.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q2-1"}
{"question": "What if I feel tired while climbing on the Great Wall of Vietnam?","answer": "If you get tired, you can take a rest by sitting in your harness for a few minutes. Our safety team will approach you to help you out. We will arrange a break time between the climb (halfway up) for everyone to rest.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q2-1"}
{"question": "How many miles or kilometers will we be walking on the trek?","answer": "The entire trek is more than 30km but it’s impossible to answer exactly how much will be covered each day due to the many mountains and boulders that you must scramble over and around in the cave.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q2-1"}
{"question": "I heard some parts of the tour have big drops and could be quite dangerous?","answer": "As with any adventure in the world, there are risks. However, safety is our top priority and there will be 7 safety team members looking after 10 guests. If you are nervous at any time, someone will always be with you. You will need to take extra care in certain places because although the path is wide, you will pass some big drops. This is why we expect people to have previous trekking experience and decent balance. We don’t recommend this tour for those with an extreme fear of heights or exposed routes. It’s critical that you always follow the instructions of your guide team so you are aware of the safest places to walk and also of any areas that are off-limits. Never wander from the group in the jungle or cave, especially without informing your guide team who will be able to assess any risks for you. This is a full adventure tour, but your well being comes first.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q2-1"}
{"question": "What happens if I begin the tour and then find that I am not fit enough to continue?","answer": "Anyone who is unable to comfortably complete any stage of the first day of trekking will be turned around to Phong Nha and will not be permitted to continue the expedition. If you, or a member of the cave expert/tour guide team decides you are physically unable to continue at this or any point, you will be escorted back to the trailhead at the top of the road and your tour will be considered concluded. Your accommodation on the last night and your transfer to Dong Hoi will still be provided for, but any costs of extra accommodation will be your responsibility. We also cannot provide an alternate tour free of charge should you need to return to Phong Nha earlier than scheduled, but we would be happy to give you recommendations for what to do in the area. We hope you understand, and we encourage you to be in your best physical condition to enjoy the entirety of the tour.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q2-1"}
{"question": "Why do I need foot powder on the tour?","answer": "Because your feet are often wet, especially on the first and second days, which can cause a painful fungal infection on your foot. The use of anti–fungal foot powder can help prevent that.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q2-2"}
{"question": "What are wet wipes used for?","answer": "Wet wipes are very important, especially at Campsite 1 (Day 2) and Campsite 2 (Day 3) in Son Doong cave where water supply is very limited and necessary for cooking and drinking. The wet wipes will help you clean yourself while bathing facilities are very limited at campsites.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q2-2"}
{ "question": "What items do I give to the porters? How do I get them to them?","answer": "The porters will carry your extra clothes, extra boots if you have them, and your toiletries. You should have this packed in time for the briefing, and our staff will deliver it to the porter team that night. The weight must not exceed 7kg.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q2-2"}
{"question": "Can I leave my luggage somewhere while I’m on an expedition?","answer": "You can store your luggage at our office. For any small valuables such as phones, laptops or wallets, please put them in another plastic bag with your name signed on the tape around, then we can secure them in our secure storage room. We will not be held responsible for items which are left inside your big bags. Also, do not bring with you anything of major value such as expensive jewelry.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q2-2"}
{"question": "It says on the packing list that I need a head torch for camp, can you be more specific?","answer": "Please bring with you a head torch to be used around camp. It does not need to be expensive or too bright, just bright enough to read in your tent and make your way around the campsite. The caving headlamps we supply you for the day must not be used around camp as they are far too bright and we have limited battery power. Please note that a handheld torch/flashlight does not take the place of a headtorch.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q2-2"}
{"question": "What do I need to bring with me to the briefing?","answer": "Please bring a signed copy of the Release Form, your packed plastic bag of items which the porters will carry for you, the footwear you plan on wearing on the tour, and any questions you may have for your guide team.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q2-2"}
{"question": "Can I bring my own alcohol with me?","answer": "We don’t encourage bringing your own alcohol because it’s heavy to carry, and because the tour is quite enjoyable without alcohol. If you do bring alcohol, you will either need to carry it in your daypack or it will need to fit within the 7 kg allotted to you which the porters will carry. We don’t condone excessive alcohol consumption and if you are found to be drinking heavily, a member of your guide team will ask you to slow down. If you continue to consume alcohol irresponsibly, you may be removed from the tour at the discretion of your guide team. We have a strict no-tolerance policy for recreational drug use.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q2-2"}
{"question": "Do I need to bring my own sleeping mat?","answer": "We will provide 2 sleeping mattresses for you, but if you would like to bring your own mat such as a Therm-a-rest, feel free to do so. If you bring your own mat, it must fit in your plastic bag which the porters will carry for you. Your plastic bag may not exceed 7 kg.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q2-2"}
{"question": "If I wear contact lenses/glasses, which should I bring on my tour?","answer": "If you wear contacts or glasses, please plan on wearing whichever you are most comfortable in on the tour, and bring the other as backup. Glasses can fog up in the humidity of the jungle or cave so some people prefer contacts.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q2-2"}
{"question": "Will there be places to take a shower?","answer": "There will be places to take a wash on a number of days during the trek, but you will not always have the opportunity to wash at the campsites. Therefore, we recommend you bring a lot of wet wipes to clean yourself at camp (a lot = no more than 100). We require that you only use soap/shampoo which is biodegradable & environmentally friendly.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q2-3"}
{"question": "I do not have much time and will arrive directly from an international flight; does this present a problem?","answer": "Yes. If you’re travelling from the US/Europe, you should spend at least 2-3 days getting acclimatized and overcoming your jetlag prior to your trek. This is especially true if you will be arriving in the summer months, as it takes some time to get used to the intense heat from May – August. We have seen in the past that those who arrive directly from an international flight are very tired, unaccustomed to the humidity, and quite slow for the first few days. To get the most out of your trip, please arrive into Vietnam several days early. This is also helpful in case of international flight delays, which have caused customers to have to cancel their tour last minute. There’s plenty to do in Phong Nha if you arrive early and would like to proceed directly here.", "url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q2-4"}
{"question": "Is there any possibility that the trek may be delayed due to weather and I would miss my outgoing flight?","answer": "This has never occurred before but you must accept the possibility that it could happen. If extremely heavy rains cause the river to rise, you could get delayed in the cave up to 24 hours (don’t worry, we have emergency supplies). To prepare for that unlikely but possible event, we suggest at least a few days extra in Vietnam prior to an international flight in case the trek is extended/delayed due to adverse weather. Since domestic travel is generally less costly to cancel or rearrange, you can have your outgoing domestic travel scheduled for any time after the end of the tour (however we take no responsibility if you need to rearrange travel plans for any reason).","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q2-4"}
{"question": "What if I'm not fit enough to complete the tour? What happens if I get turned around?","answer": "Customers are expected to make it to Son Doong entrance without assistance. Anyone who cannot do so will be turned around. We maintain the right to turn around any customers who cannot follow safety, conservation, or trekking rules, and anyone who refuses to follow the instructions of the guide team. Customers who are turned around will not receive a refund of any kind. In the event of removal from a tour, Oxalis Adventure will not be responsible for any additional expenses incurred by customers (transportation, accomodation, etc).","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q2-5"}
{"question": "I have a medical condition that I’d rather not tell you. What if you don’t accept me based on my condition(s)?",
"answer": "Most medical conditions will not exclude you: please be completely upfront about whatever condition(s) you have so we can be best prepared to accommodate you. Please, do not lie on your medical form. If you have a condition that’s possible to accommodate, we will do everything we can to do so. If you have a medical condition that might preclude you from our tour, then we need to know ahead of time so that we can make an informed decision as to whether or not we think you’d be able to complete the tour, before you arrive. We are days away from any hospital and need to know your accurate situation. If your health status changes between when your booking is approved and when you join us here, it is your responsibility to advise us of that so we can review your booking if necessary. Be advised that this tour is not for those with limited outdoor/trekking experience, those in poor medical condition, nor is it for children or expectant mothers.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q2-5"}
{"question": "Why do we need to tell you about any medical conditions?","answer": "Everything we ask is for your own safety, not to exclude you from any tour. Our tours are run in remote locations where medical care is limited to basic first aid. So if you have any medical condition, we want you and our guides to be prepared for anything. Everything you tell us will be kept in confidence and only those who need to know will be informed. In particular, we need to know about any allergies, especially to food, so we can avoid those things.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q2-5"}
{"question": "Are there bats inside the caves?","answer": "Yes, there are bats in all of the caves.

We ask that you respect them (and all wildlife) by not touching them or disturbing them in any way.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q2-6"}
{"question": "Where will I encounter leeches?","answer": "You shouldn’t find any leeches inside the caves but they are present in the jungle, mostly on tours into Phong Nha – Ke Bang National Park. This includes the Hang En Cave Adventure, Hang Va Expedition, and the Son Doong Expedition. You are unlikely to encounter any leeches on a tour to the Tu Lan cave system. Also, leeches are harmless and at most will give you an irritating bite. If you get any leech bites, let your tour guide know and he/she will apply an antiseptic once the bleeding stops.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q2-6"}
{"question": "Anything else I should know?","answer": "This is a group tour, and not everyone will want to focus on photography, so please be patient, and respect other members of the group. You will need to work as a team to get the best images.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q2-6"}
{"question": "What is your cancellation policy?","answer": "You can see details at Booking Conditions","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q2-8"}

{"question": "Do I have to wear long pants and a long sleeve t-shirt for the tour?","answer": "Yes, for your own safety.

{"question": "What types of shoes are eligible for trekking?","answer": "Because the touring terrain varies by stages, there are sections that require climbing, crossing muddy roads, wading, or swimming. Therefore, shoes with strong sole, good grip, good drainage, and comfortable to wear are best for trekking in the forest. If you do not have such shoes, we provide jungle trekking boots size from 36 to 46 (European sizing) which are available for anyone to borrow on the morning of the tour.

{"question": "Is it possible to do this tour if I arrive in Phong Nha on the same morning? Where does the tour start?","answer": "All our tours start in Phong Nha.

{"question": "Why must we use ropes, climbing harnesses and other devices to help visitors climb up and down?","answer": "In some vertical sections, it is imperative to install a ladder. In areas where ladders are more than 4m meters high or in hazardous areas, safety measures are in place to ensure that visitors are not in danger, in the event of a fall or slip. In those areas guests will be attached to a safety rope connected to a safety device (Grigri) which prevents them falling.", "url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q4-2"}
{"question": "Why are there 2 systems for climbing the  Vietnam Wall in Son Doong Cave, one for guests and one for staff?","answer": "When climbing the wall, staff and guests will all use the same rope to climb up. The only difference is the way in which people are protected. Staff have great experience and extensive training in a system of self protection. They will attach themselves to the safety line with a device called an ASAP. Should they slip, this device will lock itself on the rope and stop them falling. Staff are trained to deal with this situation and continue climbing safely. Guests do not have the experience or training to use this system, so the safety line will be attached to their harness, and controlled by members of the safety team. Should the guest have any difficulties the safety team can deal with any issues and get the guest safely and easily up the Wall. Also should anyone get tired, the safety line allows them to rest, and also allows staff to give them some assistance when climbing.","url": "https://oxalisadventure.com/faq#q4-2"}
